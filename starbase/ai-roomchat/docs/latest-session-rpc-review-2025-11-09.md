# Latest Session RPC Review â€” 2025-11-09

## Summary
- Documented the `WITHIN GROUP` ordered-set aggregate failure observed when `fetch_latest_rank_session_v2` is deployed without the required clause.
- Provided the exact remediation steps to redeploy the RPC using `docs/sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql` and highlighted the permissions that must be granted.
- Outlined validation tips to ensure Supabase logs confirm the fix before rolling the change to production.

## Ordered-set aggregate failure
Supabase surfaced the following error while invoking `fetch_latest_rank_session_v2`:

```
WITHIN GROUP is required for ordered-set aggregate mode
```

This indicates at least one ordered-set aggregate (for example `percentile_disc`, `mode`, or `ranked` helpers) inside the function body is missing a `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)` clause. When this happens the API now:

1. Returns a 502 response with `supabaseError.code = '42809'`.
2. Emits a targeted hint guiding operators to fix the SQL definition instead of silently falling back.
3. Surfaces the same hint through the Match Ready diagnostics pipeline so browser operators know the Supabase definition must be patched.

## Remediation steps
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor for the affected project.
2. Paste the full contents of [`docs/sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql`](./sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql) without modification.
3. Execute the script to recreate the function with the correct ordered-set clauses.
4. Reapply the required permissions:
   ```sql
   grant execute on function public.fetch_latest_rank_session_v2(uuid, uuid) to service_role;
   grant execute on function public.fetch_latest_rank_session_v2(uuid, uuid) to authenticated;
   ```
5. Check `pg_stat_activity` / PostgREST logs for lingering errors to confirm the deployment succeeded.

## Validation checklist
- [ ] Trigger the Match Ready diagnostics panel and confirm the latest-session hint no longer mentions `WITHIN GROUP`.
- [ ] Verify `/api/rank/latest-session` returns HTTP 200 with a session payload for the affected game IDs.
- [ ] Ensure staging and production environments run the same SQL revision by committing the script to your migration/IaC pipeline.
