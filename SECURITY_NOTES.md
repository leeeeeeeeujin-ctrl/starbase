# Security notes

Remaining issues after automatic fixes (2025-10-23):

- 2 low-severity vulnerabilities remain related to the `cookie` package used by `@supabase/ssr`.
- `npm audit fix --force` would upgrade `@supabase/ssr` to `0.7.0`, but that is a breaking change and may require code adjustments.

Recommended next steps:

1. Review release notes for `@supabase/ssr@0.7.0` and test in a feature branch.
2. If safe, perform the forced upgrade in a branch, run full test suite and E2E, and then merge.
3. If upgrade is not feasible immediately, schedule the upgrade for the next maintenance window.

This repository currently has no critical or high vulnerabilities after the previous dependency updates.
