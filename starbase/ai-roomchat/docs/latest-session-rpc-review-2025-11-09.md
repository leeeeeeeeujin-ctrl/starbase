# Latest Session RPC Review â€” 2025-11-09

## Summary

- Documented the `WITHIN GROUP` ordered-set aggregate failure observed when `fetch_latest_rank_session_v2` is deployed without the required clause.
- Provided the exact remediation steps to redeploy the RPC using `docs/sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql` and highlighted the permissions that must be granted.
- Outlined validation tips to ensure Supabase logs confirm the fix before rolling the change to production.
- Documented the circuit breaker that temporarily routes `/api/rank/latest-session` to table fallbacks after critical Supabase errors so the client stops hammering the broken RPC while still exposing diagnostics.

## Ordered-set aggregate failure

Supabase surfaced the following error while invoking `fetch_latest_rank_session_v2`:

```
WITHIN GROUP is required for ordered-set aggregate mode
```

This indicates at least one ordered-set aggregate (for example `percentile_disc`, `mode`, or `ranked` helpers) inside the function body is missing a `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)` clause. When this happens the API now:

1. Calls `fetch_latest_rank_session_v2` and records the Supabase 42809 failure.
2. Falls back to a pared-down table query that omits ordered-set fields so the client can keep operating with a best-effort session snapshot.
3. Trips a 5-minute in-memory circuit breaker so subsequent requests bypass the broken RPC and immediately serve the degraded table snapshot.
4. Returns HTTP 200 containing both the recovered session (when available) and structured diagnostics (`supabaseError`, `fallbackError`, `hint`, `via`, `circuitBreaker`) so operators still see the misconfiguration.
5. Surfaces the same hint through the Match Ready diagnostics pipeline so browser operators know the Supabase definition must be patched.

## Remediation steps

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor for the affected project.
2. Paste the full contents of [`docs/sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql`](./sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql) without modification.
3. Execute the script to recreate the function with the correct ordered-set clauses.
4. Reapply the required permissions:
   ```sql
   grant execute on function public.fetch_latest_rank_session_v2(uuid, uuid) to service_role;
   grant execute on function public.fetch_latest_rank_session_v2(uuid, uuid) to authenticated;
   ```
5. Check `pg_stat_activity` / PostgREST logs for lingering errors to confirm the deployment succeeded.

## Validation checklist

- [ ] Trigger the Match Ready diagnostics panel and confirm the latest-session hint no longer mentions `WITHIN GROUP`.
- [ ] Verify `/api/rank/latest-session` returns HTTP 200 with a session payload for the affected game IDs. If the response reports `via: "table-ordered-set-recovery"`, double-check that the RPC has been redeployed so the fallback is no longer required.
- [ ] Ensure staging and production environments run the same SQL revision by committing the script to your migration/IaC pipeline.

## Fallback snapshot limitations

- The ordered-set recovery path removes the `mode`/`match_mode` fields because the legacy Supabase definition cannot produce them without the correct `WITHIN GROUP` clauses.
- The Match Ready UI continues with the degraded snapshot but will keep surfacing diagnostics until the RPC is redeployed with the script in `docs/sql/fetch-latest-rank-session.sql`.
