# Project Assessment

## Executive Summary
- **Technology Stack**: The project runs on Next.js 14 with React 18 and Supabase SDKs, matching modern expectations and keeping community support strong.【F:starbase/ai-roomchat/package.json†L1-L17】
- **Build Health**: The current main branch builds successfully with `npm run build`, so the foundation compiles and can ship without a ground-up rewrite.【47dbbf†L1-L33】
- **Recommendation**: Preserve the existing codebase and invest in structured refactors. The feature surface area—Supabase integrations, gameplay engines, and the maker tooling—would be costly to recreate from scratch.

## Strengths Worth Keeping
- **Supabase Abstraction Layer**: `withTable` dynamically resolves table names across environments, reducing production incidents when schemas diverge and improving portability.【F:starbase/ai-roomchat/lib/supabaseTables.js†L1-L66】
- **Gameplay Engine**: `useStartClientEngine` already orchestrates bundle loading, prompt compilation, AI turn execution, and realtime constraints—logic that would take significant time to rebuild reliably.【F:starbase/ai-roomchat/components/rank/StartClient/useStartClientEngine.js†L1-L200】
- **Maker Workflow**: The React Flow–backed maker editor coordinates canvases, panels, variable drawers, and persistence hooks; keeping it avoids re-implementing complex UI behavior from scratch.【F:starbase/ai-roomchat/components/maker/editor/MakerEditor.js†L1-L160】
- **Database & Policies**: The supplied Supabase SQL seeds heroes, prompt editors, and storage policies with row-level security, which shortens onboarding and enforces auth boundaries without manual rewrites.【F:starbase/ai-roomchat/supabase.sql†L1-L160】

## Pain Points & Refactor Targets
- **Operational Gaps**: There are no automated lint/test scripts in `package.json`, signaling missing CI guardrails; add linting, type checks, and component tests before large refactors.【F:starbase/ai-roomchat/package.json†L1-L17】
- **Auth & State Coupling**: Authentication logic sprawls across hooks and providers. Consolidate session recovery, error handling, and consumer-facing hooks into a single module with integration tests to avoid the roster regressions users are reporting.
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Instrument key flows (auth, roster, maker saves) with logging/telemetry so future issues are easier to diagnose than the current silent failures.
- **Schema Drift**: Continue leveraging `withTable`, but capture schema expectations in SQL migrations or Supabase migration tooling to avoid hidden coupling between datasets and code.

## Refactor Roadmap (Suggested)
1. **Stabilize Auth**: Centralize Supabase session bootstrap, add suspense-friendly loading states, and cover critical hooks with tests.
2. **Add Quality Gates**: Introduce ESLint/Prettier and a lightweight Vitest or Jest suite to guard UI logic before iterating on features.
3. **Strengthen Telemetry**: Wrap high-value async operations with structured logging or Sentry to surface missing roster data and route errors early.
4. **Document Ownership**: Map modules to maintainers and add ADR-style notes for the maker, rank engine, and chat subsystems to reduce future architectural drift.

## Conclusion
Because the project already compiles, exposes sophisticated gameplay tooling, and ships hardened Supabase policies, a disciplined refactor will be markedly faster than rebuilding. Focus efforts on untangling auth/state management and adding safety nets rather than discarding the existing investment.
