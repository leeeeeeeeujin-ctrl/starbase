# Rank Blueprint Progress â€” 2025-11-05

## Focus
- Confirmed the post-revert baseline: lobby controls, queue clients, and manual start hooks now mirror the legacy pre-overlay flow across solo, duo, and casual modes.
- Reconciled the execution plan checklist with the restored state so the remaining backlog once again reflects score sync, shared history polish, and ops guard items.

## Notes
- No new Supabase migrations were required; the goal of this review was to validate that the current codebase matches the documented baseline before resuming feature work.
- Upcoming work will continue with Phase 2 score/state synchronization, followed by the shared-history UI sweep.
