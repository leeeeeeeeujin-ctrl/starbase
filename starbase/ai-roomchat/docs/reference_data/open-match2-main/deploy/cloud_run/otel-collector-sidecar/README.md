# Open Telemetry collector sidecar

Open-Match 2 supports the stock 'contrib' Open Telemetry collector Docker image(`otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`), run as a sidecar to collect metrics.  The example collector configuration provided in the [Google Cloud golang samples repository for Cloud Run](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/golang-samples/tree/main/run/custom-metrics/collector) works fine with Open Match 2.  You can find more details in the [Write OTLP metrics by using an OpenTelemetry sidecar](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/tutorials/custom-metrics-opentelemetry-sidecar) documentation.

## Open Match Users
The Open Match artifact registry maintains a pre-built otel collector image with the necessary config file included, and it's already referenced directly in the core/deploy/service.yaml example. You shouldn't need to modify or rebuild the image unless you're doing something advanced, like replatforming Open Match or replacing the Open Telemetry backend with a different metrics/tracing/logging provider.

## Open Match Maintainers 
To build the OpenTelemetry Collector sidecar image:
1.  Make sure your `gcloud` installation is configured to use the Open Match development project
1.  Make sure your `glcoud` installation has the `artifacts/location` config set to the location for the Open Match artifact registry
1.  Run the following command from this directory:

 `gcloud builds submit . --tag $(gcloud config get artifacts/location)-docker.pkg.dev/$(gcloud config get project)/open-match/otel-collector-sidecar`
